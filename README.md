# Daily Status bot

## Why?
Your team ever forgot to write status? Feel too cheap to pay for complex integrations you don't need? Here comes this bot.

## Deployment
Simply:
* push to heroku: [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy).
* create Slack incoming webhook URL
* Set WEBHOOK_URL and SLACK_MENTION via heroku config. Slack mention should be name of group you want to remind. Like <!subteam^S$ID|@$NAME>.
